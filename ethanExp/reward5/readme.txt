There are 3 similar models. All use train.py
All penalize death by 5. (in reality its like 40 becuse the life number flashes for 8ish frames, so the penalty for dying is ~5*8)
Difference:
- restricted training
- only barrier restricted
- no restriction


TODO: get a plot of all 3 Q values.
	Make sure to write down the hyperparams too
